# Overview

This is a sample of using python pandas in order to analyze a dataset about fast food nutrition. The dataset is downloaded from the well-known website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/fast-food as a csv file. The data displays information from multiple fast food places and gives the nutritional facts about each item on the menu. I wrote this software to compare what items are better than others and to be able to analyze the nutritional facts about each store or item.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

Question 1: What food item has the best protein-to-calorie ratio?

Answer 1: The KENTUCKY GRILLED CHICKEN BREAST has the best protein-to-calorie ratio.

# Future Work

* The data in the csv file needs to be restructured, because it did have some minor errors in it.
* Code could be rewritten to look a little cleaner.
* Look up other resources to find out how to best analyze the data.
